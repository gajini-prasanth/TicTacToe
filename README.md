# TicTacToe
This project builds a Tic Tac Toe game in Java using Swing. It applies OOP concepts, GUI design, and event handling. Players alternate turns on a 3x3 grid, with logic to detect wins, losses, or draws. A reset option restarts the game. It’s a beginner-friendly demo of interactive desktop app development.
